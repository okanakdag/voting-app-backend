# Voting App Backend

A backend API for a voting/polling application built with Java and Spring Boot.

This project is currently in progress and serves as a practice project for backend development and API design using Java.

The goal is to allow users to create polls, vote, and view poll results â€” with basic authentication and RESTful endpoints.
